# Automated Code Testing and Reporting Script

This script is designed to automate the process of code testing and reporting for a Git repository. It monitors a code repository for new commits, runs pytest for unit testing and black for code formatting check, generates reports, and creates issues on GitHub if the tests or formatting fail.

## Prerequisites

- Git: Make sure Git is installed on your system and accessible from the command line.
- Python: Install Python and pytest for running unit tests. Use pip to install pytest: `pip install pytest`.
- Black: Install Black for code formatting check. Use pip to install black: `pip install black`.
- curl: Ensure that curl is installed to make API requests to GitHub.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Change the working directory to the script's directory: `cd automated-code-testing-and-reporting`
3. Set the environment variable `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` to your GitHub personal access token. The token should have access to the repositories where you want to create issues.
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_access_token>
Make the script executable: chmod +x automated-code-testing.sh
Usage
The script accepts four arguments:

bash
Copy code
./automated-code-testing.sh <code_repo_url> <code_branch_name> <report_repo_url> <report_branch_name>
code_repo_url: The URL of the code repository to monitor for changes.
code_branch_name: The name of the branch to monitor in the code repository.
report_repo_url: The URL of the report repository where the test reports and issues will be created.
report_branch_name: The name of the branch in the report repository.
Example usage:

bash
Copy code
./automated-code-testing.sh https://github.com/your_username/code_repo.git main https://github.com/your_username/report_repo.git main
Functionality
Environment Variable Check: The script checks if the GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable is set. Make sure to set it before running the script.

Argument Check: The script validates if all four required arguments are provided. If any argument is missing, it will display an error message and exit.

Clone Repositories: The script clones the code and report repositories to temporary directories.

Check Repository and Branch Existence: The script checks if the code and report repositories exist and if the specified branches exist in both repositories. If any of the repositories or branches do not exist, it displays an error message and exits.

Check Required Tools: The script checks if pytest and black commands are available. If any of the tools are missing, it displays an error message and exits.

Cleanup Actions: The script sets up cleanup actions to remove temporary directories and files created during execution.

GitHub API Requests: The script includes functions to make GET and POST requests to the GitHub API. These functions are used to fetch user information and create issues on GitHub.

Monitor Code Repository: The script enters an infinite loop to monitor the code repository for changes. It fetches the latest changes, checks for new commits, and processes each commit individually.

Process Commits: For each new commit, the script performs the following actions:

Switches to the commit in the code repository.
Runs pytest for unit testing and saves the report to a temporary file.
Runs black for code formatting check and saves the output and diff report to temporary files.
Checks the test and formatting results and updates the corresponding issue on GitHub, if applicable.
Create Issues: If the tests or code formatting fail, the script creates or updates an issue on GitHub with the failure details.

Cleanup: At the end of execution, the script removes temporary directories and files.
